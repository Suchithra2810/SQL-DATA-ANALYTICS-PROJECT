# SQL_DataAnalytics_project

Welcome to the **SQL_DataAnalytics_project**! 🚀  
This project uses advanced SQL techniques to transform raw data from the [DataAnalyticsWareHouse] database into actionable insights through cleaning, aggregation, and reporting.

---

## Data Analytics Architecture

- **Raw Data**: Unprocessed transactional and dimensional data.
- **Transformed Data**: Data is cleaned, aggregated, and segmented using functions, CTEs, and window functions.
- **Business-Ready Data**: Analytical views and KPIs are generated for reporting and visualization.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Run SQL Scripts Sequentially**:
   - **Data Aggregation**: Execute scripts like `01_total_sales_by_date.sql` and `02_running_total_and_avg_price.sql`.
   - **Performance Analysis**: Execute scripts like `03_yearly_product_performance.sql` and `04_category_contributions.sql`.
   - **Segmentation**: Execute scripts like `05_product_segmentation.sql` and `06_customer_segmentation.sql`.
   - **Reporting Views**: Execute scripts like `07_gold_customer_reports.sql` and `08_gold_product_report.sql`.

2. **Validate & Explore**:  
   Run queries such as:
   ```sql
   SELECT TOP 100 * FROM gold_customer_reports;
   SELECT TOP 100 * FROM gold_Product_report;

3. **Integrate & Visualize**:

   The cleaned and aggregated data in the views is ready for use in reporting tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) or further SQL analysis.
